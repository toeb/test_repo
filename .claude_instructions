# Claude Instructions

This repository is a tech demo and playground for Toeb Software Platform (TSP).

## Purpose
This file provides guidance and context for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Repository Structure

### Folder Organization
- `docs/` - Documentation, architecture diagrams, and guides
- `src/` - Source code for all projects (flat structure)
  - All projects (DLLs, EXEs, modules) live as direct subdirectories of `src/`
  - Dotfiles (.editorconfig, .gitignore, etc.) are directly in `src/` and must stay compatible across all projects

### Tech Stacks
This repository contains projects using multiple technology stacks:
- **C# (Desktop & Web)**: .NET projects multi-targeting .NET 8.0 and .NET Framework 4.8
- **C++**: Build system TBD
- **Python**: Project structure TBD

### .NET Projects

#### Naming Conventions
- Use C# typical naming conventions (PascalCase)
- Root namespace: `Tsp` (Toeb Software Platform)
- Examples:
  - `Tsp.Core` - Core library
  - `Tsp.Core.Tests` - Test project for Core
  - `Tsp.Cli` - Command-line application

#### Project Configuration
- **Target Frameworks**: Multi-target `net8.0` and `net48`
- **Solution Format**: Use `.slnx` (new XML-based solution format)
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit
- **Project Style**: Minimal scaffolding

#### Build & Dependencies
- All C# projects use SDK-style project files
- Centralized package management via Directory.Build.props (if needed)

## Guidelines
- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test changes before committing
- Keep the repository organized and well-documented
- Maintain compatibility of dotfiles across all projects in src/
